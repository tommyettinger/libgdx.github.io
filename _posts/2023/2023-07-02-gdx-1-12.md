Since our last release a little over a year ago, a great deal of work has been done! libGDX 1.12.0 includes some exciting new features as well as all-around improvements in various areas. Take a look below to find out more!

### Audio Switch API
On the LWJGL 3 backend, we now offer an audio switch API ([#6973](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/6973)). This has three advantages:
- The output device is automatically switched if the current one is disconnected (e.g., when headphones get unplugged). This is mainly relevant on Windows, where previously the audio just died in this case.
- The default output device is reevaluated if a new device gets connected. I.e., the application may switch to the new audio device (upon the OS's decision).
- It is now possible to select a specific audio device. See `Audio#switchOutputDevice` and `Audio#getAvailableOutputDevices`

### Haptics API
libGDX 1.12.0 adds a Haptics API for iOS and Android. Check out the four `Input#vibrate` methods for more information.

### MetalANGLE Backend
We have recently added a new MobiVM MetalANGLE backend ([#6681](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/6681)). This backend uses [MetalANGLE](https://github.com/kakashidinho/metalangle) (a fork of Google's [ANGLE](https://github.com/google/angle)) to translate OpenGL specific calls into Metal ones. This is an important step in making the iOS backend future proof, considering that Apple has deprecated OpenGL support on its devices. To use this backend just replace `gdx-backend-robovm` in your dependencies with `gdx-backend-robovm-metalangle`.

### OpenGL ES 3.1 & 3.2 Support for LWJGL 3
The LWJGL 3 backend now supports OpenGL ES 3.1 & 3.2 ([#6945](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/6945)). This allows for some interesting features in the future, like [compute shaders](https://github.com/mgsx-dev/libgdx/tree/modern-shaders/compute) and [geometry and tessellation shaders](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4963).

### WebGL 2
The GWT backend now supports WebGL 2 ([#7037](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/7037)), which is the Web equivalent of OpenGL ES 3.0. This means that all of our backends now support OpenGL ES 3.0 (or at least most of its API)! To try it out, use `GwtApplicationConfiguration#useGL30`.

## A few notable changes
- Touch cancel events (e.g., when the lock button is used while currently touching the screen) are now properly handled on iOS and Android. In those cases, libGDX 1.12.0 calls `InputProcessor#touchCancelled` instead of `InputProcessor#touchUp` (see [#6871](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/6871)); to keep the old behaviour, let your `#touchCancelled` implementations call `#touchUp`.
- Updated to [MobiVM 2.3.19](https://github.com/MobiVM/robovm/wiki/Changelog#2319-march-2023) from 2.3.16. This adds iOS 16 bindings.
- Updated to [LWJGL 3.3.2](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3/releases/tag/3.3.2) from 3.3.1.

### Other breaking changes
**Android:**
- On Android, immersive mode is now true by default. Set `AndroidApplicationConfiguration#useImmersiveMode` to `false` to disable it.

**Desktop:**
- The return value of `AudioDevice#getLatency()` is now in samples, and not milliseconds
- We had to drop support for older libc versions since libGDX is now built on Ubuntu 20.04 (see [#7005](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/7005))

**iOS:**
- We increased the minimum supported iOS version to 11.0. Update your `Info.plist` file if necessary.
- 32 bit (armv7) builds are no longer supported. Builds must be 64 bit (arm64) only.
- We now use dynamic frameworks instead of static libs
- `IOSApplicationConfiguration#hideHomeIndicator` is now set to `false` by default
- `IOSApplicationConfiguration#screenEdgesDeferringSystemGestures` is now set to `UIRectEdge.All` by default (was `UIRectEdge.None`)
- The preferred FPS on iOS are now uncapped
- On iOS, `ApplicationListener#create` and the first `#resize` are now called within `UIApplicationDelegate#didFinishLaunching`. This allows for earlier rendering and prevents black screen frames after launch screen. Please note, that your app will get terminated if this method blocks for more than 10-20 seconds!

**Scene2D:**
- `Actor#localToAscendantCoordinates` throws an exception if the specified actor is not an ascendant.
- `WidgetGroup#hit` first validates the layout
- The `Cell` getters return object wrappers instead of primitives.

**3D:**
- `MeshPartBuilder#lastIndex` now returns an int instead of a short
- The max bone weight is now configurable and limited to 4 by default (see [#6522](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/6522)).
- `Mesh#getVerticesBuffer`, `Mesh#getIndicesBuffer`, `VertexData#getBuffer`, and `IndexData#getBuffer` are deprecated in favour of new methods with a boolean parameter.
- `Mesh#bind` and `Mesh#unbind` have a new parameter for instanced attribute locations. If you use these methods without instancing, you can pass a null value.
