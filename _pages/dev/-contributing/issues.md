Please note that the issue tracker isn't for personal assistance. If you have a problem that isn't a reproducible bug in the core framework, please ask on our [Discord](/community/discord/) server instead.
{: .notice--info}

Before you report an issue on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues), we ask you to do a few things:
- Verify that the problem hasn’t already been reported on the tracker. If that is the case, please add your own information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a [reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) can also help indicate that a particular problem is affecting more than just one user.
- Make sure the bug hasn’t already been fixed. Use the latest snapshot of libGDX to try to reproduce your issue.
- Create a concise, self-contained example to demonstrate the issue. If we can’t reproduce your issue, we can’t fix it.

Once you have done this, [create a new issue](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/new) in the project and follow the instructions in the template that is shown to help us triage your issue.
